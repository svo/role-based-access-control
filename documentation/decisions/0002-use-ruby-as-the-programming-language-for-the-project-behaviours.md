# 2. Use ruby as the programming language for the project behaviours

Date: 2021-03-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

### Ideal

We are using a programming language that balances the interests and skills of the current contributor as well as the interests and skills represented within the organisation.

### Reality

In reality we have multiple options to consider and potentially a variety of opinions.

### Consequences

* we cannot start development without choosing a programming language
* maintenance is a concern if we select a language not in use by the organisation

### Options

#### Option 1: Ruby

Pros:

* one of the organisation defaults
* current contributor is keen to do another project using the language to refresh and improve skills

Cons:

* current contributor has experience in the language but hasn't worked with it recently

#### Option 2: JavaScript

Pros:

* one of the organisation defaults

Cons:

* current contributor has experience in the language but hasn't worked with it for an extended period of time
* current contributor would favour other options

#### Option 3: PHP

Pros:

* one of the organisation defaults

Cons:

* current contributor has experience in the language but hasn't worked with it for an extended period of time
* current contributor would favour other options

#### Option 4: Clojure

Pros:

* default general purpose language choice of current contributor

Cons:

* not being used within the organisation currently

#### Option 5: Kotlin

Pros:

* current contributor is looking to do another project with the language to build on current experience

Cons:

* not being used within the organisation currently

#### Option 6: Elixir

Pros:

* current contributor is looking for an opportunity to write a project in the language

Cons:

* not being used within the organisation currently

## Decision

We will use Ruby for implementing the project behaviours.

## Consequences

* project development will be slightly delayed due to choice not being the current contributor default
* language choice means organisation is well placed to own behaviours moving forward
* language choice allows for faster development by current contributor than would be possible with the other languages being used within the organisation
